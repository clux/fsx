# fsx

Just a small utility that I had to copy for many of my modules.
Will scan a directory recursively, keep track of both files and directories, and return two flattened arrays.

Install with

````bash
npm install fsx
````

then

````javascript
var fsx = require('fsx');
var output = fsx.readDirSync(dir);
````

yielding:

````javascript
console.log(output);
->
{
  dirs: [pathstodirs],
  files: [paths to files],
}
````
